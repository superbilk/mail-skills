Title: Product Owner Course
Subtitle: Methods and skills that will make you better and more effective in your new role
*/

Are you starting out as a Scrum Product Owner? Or are you a Product Manager wondering what methods people in the Agile camp are using? Great, you’ve come to the right place mailing list!

We are working on an email course that introduces you to methods and skills that will make you a better, more effective Product Owner. We’ll start with basics such as the User Story format (week 1), move on to Definition of Done (week 6) and end near Impact Mapping (week 9). We’re planning 10 topics in total - 1 topic per week.

Well, it’s not really a course in so far, as we’re not creating original material. Instead we will send you the best link on the topic that we know of. The one we constantly send out to friends and colleagues when they ask us about that topic. Additionally, we provide context: When is this method useful, how did it work for us, etc.

Would you like get a smoother start into your new role? Then sign up and be the first one to receive the weekly featured skill when we’re starting (probably within Feb 2014).

Ah, one more thing: It’s free!
