Are you starting out in an Agile environment or a Scrum Role? Or just wondering what methods people in the Agile camp are using? Great, youâ€™ve come to the right <s>place</s> mailing list!

We run free email courses that introduce you to methods and skills that will make you a better, more effective Product Owner. Each course has 10 topics in total - 1 topic per week.

We introduce each topic by setting the context: <em>When is this method helpful.</em> <em>How did it work for us.</em> Then we add the single best link on the topic we have come across in years and years of reading about Agile and PO topics. That one link we constantly send out to friends and colleagues whenever they need advice on that topic.

Topics range from User Stories, move on to Business Model Canvas and end near Impact Mapping. It's a broad range of methods and skills we think every Product Owner should know about.

Would you like get a smoother start into your new role? Then sign up now!
