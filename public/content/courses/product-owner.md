Are you starting out in a new Agile Environment or a Scrum Role? Or just wondering what methods people in the Agile camp are using? Great, you’ve come to the right <s>place</s> mailing list!

We run free email courses that introduce you to methods and skills that will make you a better, more effective Product Owner. Each course has 10 topics in total - 1 topic per week.

We introduce each topic, setting the context: When is this method helpful. How did it work for us. ..
Then we add the single best link on the topic we have come across in years and years of reading
about Agile and PO topics. That one link we constantly send out to friends and colleagues whenever they
need advice on that topic.

Topics range from User Story format (Week 1), move on to Definition of Ready (Week 6)
and end near Impact Mapping (Week 9).

Would you like get a smoother start into your new role? Then sign up and be the first one to receive
the weekly featured skill when we’re starting (probably within Feb 2014).
