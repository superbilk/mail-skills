Are you starting out in a new Agile Environment or a Scrum Role? Or just wondering what methods people in the Agile camp are using? Great, you’ve come to the right <s>place</s> mailing list!

We run free email courses that introduce you to methods and skills that will make you better and more effective. Each course has 10 topics in total - 1 topic per week.

<div class="well well-lg text-center">
  <p>Our first course <em>Product Owner</em> is available soon. You can sign up right now and we'll let you know when it starts.</p>
  <a href="/courses/product-owner"><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Learn more about the free <em>Product Owner Course</em></button></a>
</div>

Well, it’s not really a course in so far, as we’re not creating original material. Instead we will send you the best link on the topic that we know of. The one we constantly send out to friends and colleagues when they ask us about that topic. Additionally, we provide context: When is this method useful, how did it work for us, etc.

Would you like get a smoother start into your new role? Then sign up and be the first one to receive the weekly featured skill when we’re starting (probably within Feb 2014).
