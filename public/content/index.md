Are you starting out as a Scrum Product Owner? Or are you a Product Manager wondering what methods people in the Agile camp are using? Great, you’ve come to the right <s>place</s> mailing list!

We are working on an email course that introduces you to methods and skills that will make you a better, more effective Product Owner. We’ll start with basics such as the User Story format (week 1), move on to Definition of Ready (week 6) and end near Impact Mapping (week 9). We’re planning 10 topics in total - 1 topic per week.

We introduce each topic, setting the context: When is this method helpful. How did it work for us. ..
Then we add the single best link on the topic we have come across in years and years of reading
about Agile and PO topics. That one link we constantly send out to friends and colleagues whenever they
need advice on that topic.

Would you like get a smoother start into your new role? Then sign up and be the first one to receive
the weekly featured skill when we’re starting (probably within Feb 2014).
